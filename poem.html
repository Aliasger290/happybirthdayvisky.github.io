                    I almost forgot your birthday again, <br>
                    I was watching batman fight bane, <br>
                    Luckily the mobile notification I didn’t ignore, <br>
                    Hence Google calendar saved me once more, <br>
                    <br>
                    Since its your birthday I sit here to write, <br>
                    We don’t talk much so I hope you’re doing alright. <br>
                    We’ve been through so much already, <br>
                    Still a long way to go for life to be steady. <br>
                    <br>
                    I hope today you enjoy yourself, <br>
                    Keep all the worries in the back of the shelf. <br>
                    Adulthood sucks I know, <br>
                    But let’s take our own time to grow. <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though I make you mad and you drive me nuts, <br>
                    We will always have each other’s trust. <br>
                    We laugh, we cry, we make time fly. <br>
                    Together we smile, together we sigh. <br>
                    <br>
                    We share our dreams, these desires that burn, <br>
                    And someday we believe will be our turn! <br>
                    Eight long years and we are still going strong <br>
                    For the understanding we share in life's ping-pong. <br>
                    <br>
                    We will reach our destination, our time will come, <br>
                    In that journey we will leave our bread crumbs. <br>
                    But for now, jump up high and touch the sky, <br>
                    Let laughter soar and silliness fly. <br>
                    <br>
                    Life gives you lessons to learn as you grow, <br>
                    Room for mistakes and time to show what you know. <br>
                    Just be patient because things will soon go your way. <br>
                    Enjoy the young times and have a happy birthday! <br>
